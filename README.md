# My First JS React Website
- My first goal was to create a static website hosted on AWS. Something simple and to get me familiar with some web dev basics.
  - Interesting problems here were how to register my domain and set up my AWS environment to host my static website
  - Also ensuring that my website was using https
- Next I built out a couple different pages, an About Me, Reusume, and Project sections
- I added in a nav bar and loading graphics for some basic functionality and aesthetics
  - Some interesting and fun challenges here were to make a scrollable transluscent text box over my background
  - Flexible optimization for mobile and desktop
- Additional troubleshooting to figure out why my website would error out when opened from in-app browsers
  - This ended up being a domain issue where my website was only registered to website-url.com, however many in-app browsers will try to open a website by automatically appending www. to the front, so it was not able to find my domain. Once I registered a second address with www. at the front my website was able to load without issue in in-app browsers
- I am now working on updating my nav bar to look more modern and asthetic
- I am also working on taking my website from dynamic to static and creating a data dashboard with a live data feed that can run autonomously within my AWS env

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
